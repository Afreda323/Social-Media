# RIP Social Media Project
THis was going to be an attempt at creating a social media application. 
The front end was just about complete, but the back end is pretty bad. It sort of works, you can create an account and login, but the rest of the data is placeholder content.
I may come back to this eventually, but I want to focus on mastering Node before diving into developing a social media backend.  I also have another project idea that I want to start.
